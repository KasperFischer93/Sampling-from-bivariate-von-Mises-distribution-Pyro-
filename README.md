# Bivariate-von-Mises
Pyro class to generate samples from the bivariate von Mises distributions


Implementation of bivariate von Mises distribution (sampler) in the probabilistic programming languague, Pyro. The use-case for this is modelling protein structures since proteins in 3D space are represented by angles, which can be modelled by von Mises distributions.


The univariate von Mises distribution has been implemented in pyro here:
